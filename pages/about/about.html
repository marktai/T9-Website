            <p>My name is Mark Tai, if you didn't already get that.  </p>

            <p>Fun facts about me: I feel right at home when coding, playing trad jazz, gaming, or getting KBBQ.  My favorite Pokemon is Gengar.  I use three monitors, a mechanical keyboard, and a gaming mouse to work, game, and browse Reddit.  </p>

            <p>On a more serious note, I'm currently studying Computer Science at UCLA.  I enjoy learning the more theoretical side of programming in classes and being able to apply it to what I create in my own time.  UCLA gives me the opportunity to see the science part of Computer Science that's not just building cool things.  </p>

            <p>I'd love being a part of any coding project that you have in mind, from making a website to being part of creating a satellite interface.  Just pick a way to contact me on my <a href="/#contact">contact page</a>, and I'll respond as soon as I get the notification.  </p>

            <p>If you want to see even more things I've done, check out my <a href = "/upload/Mark_Tai_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
